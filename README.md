# **Bouncing Ball Animation**

This project showcases a basic **Bouncing Ball Animation** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The ball moves around the screen, bouncing off the edges, simulating real-world physics like gravity and collisions.

## **Features**:
- **Smooth Animation**: The ball moves smoothly across the screen, simulating a natural bounce.
- **Collision Detection**: The ball bounces when it reaches the boundaries of the screen.
- **Responsive Design**: The animation adapts to different screen sizes.

## **Technologies Used**:
- **HTML5** for structuring the page.
- **CSS3** for styling and basic layout.
- **JavaScript** for handling the ball's movement, collision detection, and physics simulation.
